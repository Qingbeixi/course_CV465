 This file is used to caculate the oil consumption as well as other parameters within a driving cycle.
 1. The data related to the vehicle traveling is in cycle/udds file. The first column is time series and the second column is the speed of vehicle at that time. You can change the speed of vehicle in that file to create different driving conditions you want.(Slight modification is ok)
 2. The src/run ipynb file is used to caculate the oil consumption for the driving cycle in the cycle/udds file. Just run it and you will get the oil consumption data. Actually, to be more convenient in research, you can output the "output" parameters in that file to see more parameters with in that cycle.(reproductivity)
 3. To get more details in the oil comsumption caculation, you can open the src/FASTSim where contains the annotation of the output as well as input parameters.
 4. Just begin with try the src/run ipynb file!
